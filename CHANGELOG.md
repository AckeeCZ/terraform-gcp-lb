## [v1.2.0] - 2021-02-14
### Added
- Parameter `managed_certificate_name` which can override default managed certificate name - useful when migrating from Ingress-provisioned

### Fixed
- Added Parameter `backend_bucket_location` defining location of backend bucket that is used when our load balancers receive request that 
does not have HTTP header Host mathching our domain in `hostname`. Previous usage of parameter `region` prevented from creating bucket when
we had only zonal load-balancer (e.g. europe-west3-c was invalid location for bucket)

## [v1.0.0] - 2021-02-10
### Added
- Add initial commit with POC, example, pre-commit hooks
